# Restaurant Page

This page was a project as part of the Odin Project. 
The purpose was to create a page the contents of which is generated using JavaScript entirely, instead of written in HTML, as well as using Webpack.
To that end I first created a HTML page to visualize the structure, and then turned it into JavaScript. 

The page is inspired by Italian gelaterias, and specifically La Romana. Credit to them for the assets: https://www.gelateriaromana.com/en/
